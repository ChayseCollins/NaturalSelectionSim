# PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
I just had the wonderful idea of documenting everything that im doing in a seperate document, so anyone (likely future me) can come back and see exactly what I was thinking at the time. It'll probably make this project longer, and I know i'll probably hate myself for it in the future since it's gonna be a lot of writing, but I can yell at myself over it later.
## FIRST STEPS
I myself, do not know all that much about how to do graphics, and I just recently learned how classes and objects work, so I will have to look into how to do both of those things.

The first thing I should probably do is make a list of things I know I have to do, and lay it all out. Ill make a trello kanban board filled with stuff, and leave the link below.

^ This is the link to the trello if anyone wants to see what is currently being worked on, ill probably put it in the README as well.
