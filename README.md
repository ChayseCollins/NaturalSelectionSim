# NaturalSelectionSim
This idea is a little fun simulator program that has multiple little guys running around collecting fruit, and those with better fitness pass on to the next generation, passing along their genes (with slight mutations).

Around freshman year of high school, when I was taking biology, I had the idea of wanting to make this. However, at the time, I had 0 coding experience, so I tried for a little bit, then got distracted. Now that I somewhat know what i'm doing (not really), I thought it would be a neat first personal project to do.

As of right now, I have no clue how i'm going to go about this, or what this will look like, but I think this will definitely help me more with some fundamentals and _probably_ force me to learn some new things?????

I would **REALLY** like to have some sort of visual thing, but I also understand graphics is really hard. I will do my best, and try not to cry _too_ much.
